With the simple idea in mind to just track your lifts an know the intensity of each workout and, more importante, if you are improving or not borns **[Worke.app ðŸ’ª](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.phalcon.worke_app)**.

### Calculate and track the 1RM of each lift you do
The 1RM is the maximum weight you can lift at one repetition for a given movement. By calculating this mark, you can find out at what intensity you are working at any given time without always going to the maximum and thus increase, week by week, the intensity of your workouts.

This is important because if you train at the same intensity you will not make progress and, at the same time, if you train at the same intensity you will injure yourself. With this application you can calculate your maximum training intensity without always going to the maximum, without risking injury or damage.

âž¡ Records the main exercises of your training and sees, in a comfortable graph, how you are evolving.  
âž¡ Calculates the 1RM of each of your lifts.  
âž¡ Simple, fast, without wasting time. Register your workouts and lifts in a matter of seconds.
